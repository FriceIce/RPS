# Rock Paper Scissors Game

# Introduction
Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) is a game with a long history and several variants spanning many centuries. RPS in its modern form originated in Japan as Jenken, with the earliest traces of the game in Europe and America dating back to the 1920s and 1930s. I chose to cretae the latest version of RPS as well as Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (RPSLS), popularized in the TV series The Big Bang Theory.
